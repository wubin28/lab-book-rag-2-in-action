请你修改 @ch01/conversational_rag_with_memory.py 文件，使其从使用OpenAI API改为使用DeepSeek-reasoner API，并且DeepSeek API的key需要在运行命令时让用户输入，而不是在代码中硬编码。另外用户输入api key时，屏幕不要显示出来，以便保密。

I'll help you modify the file to use DeepSeek-reasoner API with secure API key input. Let me first read the current file to understand its structure.

Now I'll modify the file to use DeepSeek-reasoner API with secure API key input:

Perfect! I've successfully modified the file. Here's what I changed:

## Summary of Changes:

1. **Added secure API key input**: Imported `getpass` module and added code to prompt the user for their DeepSeek API key. The input will be hidden on screen for security.

2. **Updated to DeepSeek API**: 
   - Changed the embeddings configuration to use DeepSeek's API endpoint (`https://api.deepseek.com/v1`)
   - Changed the LLM model from `gpt-4-turbo` to `deepseek-reasoner`
   - Configured both embeddings and chat model to use the DeepSeek API key and base URL

3. **No hardcoded credentials**: The API key is now requested at runtime and not stored in the code.

When you run the script, it will prompt:
```
Please enter your DeepSeek API key:
```

And your input will be hidden (not displayed on screen) for security.

The linter warnings shown are related to LangChain package imports and were already present - they're not related to the changes I made. They'll be resolved once the required packages are installed in your environment.
